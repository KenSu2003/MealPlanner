3. take in to account of portion size

Additional Features on a New Branch (Tokens and Price)
I am thinking that we give free users one token every month to have the AI Automatically generate a meal plan.
For now I am not sure if they get to type in a prompt or not.
For the paid users they get around 10 tokens and they get to type in the prompt to generate.
Not sure which api to use yet. 
Maybe we'll have adds maybe not. 
Might also let users earn tokens for sharing receipes on the community but not sure how to regulate.

Marketing Game Plan:
Share a screenshot and video on Reddit to the Mom's and ask for their opinion. 
Emphasize it will be compelte free because I am inspired by them.
Also be transparent that there will be a paid version but should not affect the basic functionality that they currently see.

Legalities
