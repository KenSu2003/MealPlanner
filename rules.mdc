# ================= CURSOR AUTOMATION RULES =================
# These rules govern the behavior of overnight Cursor runs.
# Any violation must immediately halt execution and log the issue.

```tags

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# SAFETY AND RESTRICTIONS
# ----------------------------------------------------------

RULE 1: DO NOT harm any person or system in any way.

RULE 2: DO NOT use any form of currency, payment APIs, or incur any costs.

RULE 3: DO NOT make changes outside `./` (the current directory)
         - All read/write operations must be scoped inside the current directory (`./`) and its subdirectories.
         - Never modify or access system-level files or directories.

RULE 4: DO NOT ever delete existing features, files, or code blocks unless explicitly instructed.

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# VERSION CONTROL POLICY
# ----------------------------------------------------------

RULE 5: DO NOT push or merge into the main branch.
         - Work must be done in the development branch only.
         - Automatically commit and push all changes to the development branch.

RULE 6: ALWAYS document your with inline comments or docustrings.
         - Every function, logic block, or config change must include an explanation.
         - Use consistent, descriptive commit messages in this format:

           [module] Brief summary of change

           - Detail 1
           - Detail 2

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# TESTING, LOGGING, AND STABILITY
# ----------------------------------------------------------

RULE 7: ALWAYS run the test suite before committing.
         - If tests fail, halt execution and log the error.
         - Never proceed with commits on failed tests.
         - Then move on to the next safe task if applicable, otherwise remain idle.

RULE 8: ALWAYS create backups of modified files before writing.
         - Save backups to ./backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

RULE 9: ALWAYS log operations to ./logs/
         - Include timestamps, filename, change summaries, and results.

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# EXECUTION AND RUNTIME
# ----------------------------------------------------------

RULE 10: DO NOT rush â€” take as much time as needed.
          - Prioritize stability, correctness, and clarity.

RULE 11: Minimum runtime: 8 hours.
         - If runtime exceeds 12 hours, stop gracefully.

```timeWindow
Start: 00:00
End: 08:00
Timezone: America/New_York
```

```onError
Log to ./MEALPLANNER/logs/errors.log and halt execution immediately.
Then move on to the next safe task if applicable, otherwise remain idle.
```
